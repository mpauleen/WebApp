P6 - Computer Prototype

We've made some refinements to our tasks from P3:
-Task 1: An incoming High School senior decides how to rank her housing options for the survey thatâ€™s safe but fun. Can be seen in implementation that she can use the (non-functional) college fun filter in comparison to the dangerous crime filter to find a place that is safe but fun (see P3)
-Task 2 (Depth task): A current Bobb resident finds and downloads data on thefts in his dorm to show to his roommate. Hopefully it should be obvious how to accomplish this, but if it's not, locations are clickable and the Theft checkbox filters by that type (though no others do). This task is fully implemented for Bobb and Theft, but this was our primary focus and other aspects work as well.
-Task 3: An off-campus student find and shares with her friend the safest route home from a bar. It can be seen in the implementation that a (non-functional) heatmap option is available, and the map is zoomable. This allows the user to resize the map to show the area in question, and then see where dangerous crime is densest along the route.

Notes:
-Implemented for Chrome Browser
-Implemented with full-screen window size
-Used checkboxes resources from csscheckbox.com
-Map sourced from Leaflet.js
-Some UI elements from Bootstrap
-Uses jQuery
-Data scraped from NUPD evanston blotter
